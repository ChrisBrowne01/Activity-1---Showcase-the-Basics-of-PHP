# Activity 1: Showcase the Basics of PHP

**Project Description:**

This mini-project is designed to help students at the beginning of their PHP programming studies gain hands-on experience with the fundamental concepts of PHP syntax. The objective is to create a simple PHP script that demonstrates an understanding of various PHP syntax elements, including creating PHP files, executing PHP files, variable declarations, using the echo construct to output PHP code and commenting in PHP.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a New File:
    - Start by creating a new file with a **.php** extension, for example, **index.php**.
    - This file will serve as the main script for your project.

2. Add a Description:

    - At the beginning of the file, add a brief description as a PHP comment explaining the purpose of the script and what it aims to achieve. (e.g. `// A simple PHP script that outputs the name and age of a user.`)

3. Demonstrate PHP Syntax:

    - Use the opening `<?php` and closing `?>` tags to define a PHP code block.
    - Declare a variable and assign a value to the variable as a string data type. (e.g. `$userName = "John";`)
    - Declare another variable and assign a value to the variable as a number data type. (e.g. `$userAge = 32;`)
    - Use an echo statement to output the values of the variables as part of a string of text. (e.g. `echo "Hello  $userName your age is $userAge !";`)

4. Commenting:

    - Use single-line comments (`//` or `#`) to explain the purpose of each code block or section.
    - Utilize multi-line comments (`/* ... */`) to provide a more detailed explanation of the script's functionality.
    - Comment out a section of code and explain the behavior when that code is not executed.

5. Test your PHP:

    - Test your PHP files in a local server (e.g. XAMPP) or on a web server.

## Summary

By completing this mini-project, students will demonstrate their understanding of the basics of PHP syntax, including variable declarations, using echo to output data to the web browser and commenting in your PHP code. They will create a simple PHP script that showcases these concepts and prepares them for more advanced PHP programming tasks. Additionally, they will gain experience in creating and managing files within a project structure, which can be shared on platforms like GitHub to showcase their skills.
